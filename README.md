## [Project 2: Sales analysis and forecasting - Cracken Coffee](https://github.com/Vivek-Harisree/PowerBI-Projects/tree/main/Cracken%20Coffee%20Sales%20Infographics)
In this project, I developed a sales performance report for Cracken Coffee, a retail coffee business. The dataset spans over 6 months and includes key sales metrics. The analysis involved identifying top-performing products, categories, and conducting time-based sales analysis to track trends and seasonality. Additionally, I implemented a forecasting model to predict future sales trends based on historical data. This report provides actionable insights for decision-makers to enhance product offerings, optimize inventory, and forecast demand.
